  <H3>1. Computation 2.Storage 3. Network</H3>
 <B> 1.Computation :-</B>
<BR> computation is the process of using a set of rules (an algorithm) to manipulate data and produce a result.</BR>
 <BR>1.1 CPU-central processing unit </BR>
<BR> 1.2 GPU-graphic processing unit  </BR>
 <BR>1.3 DPU-data processing unit </BR>
 <BR>1.4 TPU-tensor processing unit </BR>
<BR> 1.5 APU accelerated processing unit </BR>
<H2># CHIP:-</H2>
  As the name suggested is an entire system fabricated on a silicon chip.the main work of this chip is it integrades all the component on a single substrate .as its size reducing and increasing efficiency.

<H2>2.OPERATING SYSTEM(OS):-</H2>
 <BR> An operating system (OS) is essential system software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources, acting as an intermediary between the user and the computer.</BR>
  <H4>The  most commonly used OS are:-</H4> 
  
 <em> * WINDOWS</em> 
 
 <em> * MACos</em> 
 
 <em> * LINUX</em>
 
 <BR> {In an operating system, user space and kernel space are two distinct memory regions with different access privileges.} </BR>
 
<H3>2.1 USER SPACE:-</H3>
    User space is where applications and non-essential programs run.
    
<H3>.2.2 KERNEL SPACE:-</H3>
    kernel space is reserved for the operating system's core components (the kernel) and essential functions.

<H2>3.NETWORK:-</H2>
<BR>3.1Local Area Network (LAN)</BR>
<BR>3.2 Wide Area Network (WAN)</BR>
<BR>3.3 Metropolitan Area network(MAN)</BR>

<BR> # Networks can be broadly categorized into private and public networks, with local networks often being a type of private network. Private networks offer controlled access and are typically used for specific groups or organizations, while public networks are open to anyone and offer broader connectivity</BR>
  <BR>**EXAMPLES OF PRIVATE NETWORK :-**</BR>
   <BR>a.Local Area Network (LAN)</BR>
  <BR> b.Virtual Private Network (VPN)</BR>
   <BR>c.Enterprise Private Network</BR>
 <BR> **EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC NETWORK:-**</BR>
  <BR> a.Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</BR>
  <BR> b.Wide Area Network (WAN)</BR>
<BR> <H3>3.4 NIC(network interface card):-</BR> </H3>
  <P>A network interface card, also known as NIC or network interface controller, is typically a circuit board installed on the computer to connect to the network. It works as an indispensable component for the network connection of computers.</P> 

 <H3>Open Source/ Closed Source:-</H3>
  <BR> a.Open source software (OSS) is software where the source code is publicly available, allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute it.</BR>
  <BR> b.Closed-source software, also known as proprietary software, is software where the source code is not publicly available. Users typically acquire the right to use the software through a license.</BR>
